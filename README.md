# Touch Portal Plugin for Indigo
The Touch Portal Plugin for Indigo provides a bridge
between Indigo and the Touch Portal software service.

The Touch Portal Plugin for Indigo allows users to 
create custom Touch Portal control screens that 
link the [Touch Portal](https://www.touch-portal.com) 
software service to Indigo actions, devices and 
variables. It provides a bridge that makes it 
possible to control aspects of Indigo via Touch 
Portal pages. For example, with the plugin, you can 
turn Indigo relay devices on and off by pressing a 
Touch Portal button.
